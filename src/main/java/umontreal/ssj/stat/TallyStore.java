/**
 * This class is a variant of  @ref Tally for which the individual
 * observations are stored in a list implemented as a  DoubleArrayList.
 * The class `DoubleArrayList` is imported from the COLT library and provides
 * an efficient way of storing and manipulating a list of real-valued numbers
 * in a dynamic array.
 * The  DoubleArrayList object used to store the values can be either passed
 * to the constructor or created by the constructor, and can be accessed via
 * the  #getDoubleArrayList method.
 *
 * The same counters as in  @ref Tally are maintained and are used by the
 * inherited methods. One must access the list of observations to compute
 * quantities not supported by the methods in  @ref Tally, and/or to use
 * methods provided by the COLT package.
 *
 * *Never add or remove observations directly* on the  DoubleArrayList
 * object, because this would put the counters of the `TallyStore` object in
 * an inconsistent state.
 *
 * There are two potential reasons for using a  @ref TallyStore object
 * instead of directly using a  DoubleArrayList object: (a) it can broadcast
 * observations and (b) it maintains a few additional counters that may speed
 * up some operations such as computing the average.
