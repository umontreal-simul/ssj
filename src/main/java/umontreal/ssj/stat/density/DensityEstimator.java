/**
 * This abstract class represents a univariate density estimator (DE). 
 * 
 * Both static and non-static methods are offered.  
 * In a majority of cases, on simply wishes to estimate the density at a finite set of evaluation
 * points, from a given set of data, and perhaps plot the estimated density. 
 * To do that, there is no need to create an object. 
 * One can simply use a static `evalDensity` method followed by `plotDensity`.
 * Note that calling the `evalDensity` method only once for a vector of evaluation points 
 * is typically much faster than calling it separately for each evaluation point.
 * 
 * In case one plans to evaluate the same density several times with the same data,
 * then it may be worthwhile to construct a `DensityEstimator` object and build the 
 * density estimate from the given data.  After that, one can evaluate the density 
 * at any given point, often much faster than by calling the static method. 
 * In the case of a histogram or average shifted histogram, for example,
 * constructing the density estimator takes time, but once it is constructed, 
 * evaluating it is relatively fast.
 * For a KDE with fixed bandwidth, the difference (or gain) may be small.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * In a non-abstract subclass, it suffices (in principle) to implement the abstract method
 * @ref evalDensity(double, double[], double, double), which evaluates the density
 * at a single point \f$x\f$ given the data points.
 * However, other methods will typically be overridden to make them more efficient.
 * For example, evaluating the DE over a set of evaluation points 
 * \f$\{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{k-1}\} \f$ can often be performed more efficiently than 
 * by calling `evalDensity(x)` repeatedly in a loop. 
 * 
 * More precisely, the single
 * point evaluation `evalDensity(double, double[], double, double)` is abstract,
 * since it will definitely differ between realizations.???   
 * You mean across subclasses???   For the evaluation on a
 * set of points one can use `evalDensity(double[], double[], double, double).`
 * Even though a default implementation is provided, very often
 * specific estimators will have more efficient evaluation algorithms. So,
 * overriding this method can be beneficial in many cases. Furthermore, this
 * class includes a method to plot the estimated density.
 * 
 * This class also provides more elaborate methods that deal with the convergence 
 * behavior of the DEs in terms of their IV, ISB, and MISE. 
 * 
 * Nevertheless, they
 * can be useful in many other cases beyond convergence behavior too. As these
 * usually require more than one realization of a DE, or even a list of DE's,
 * they are implemented as static methods. For instance, @ref evalDensity(double[],
 * double[][], double, double) allows to evaluate several independent
 * replications of a DE at an array of evaluation points, and
 * @ref evalDensity(ArrayList, double[], double[][], double, double, ArrayList)  does
 * the same but for more than one DE.
 * 
 * This class also provides methods to estimate the empirical IV, see
 * @ref computeIV(double[][], double, double, double[]) for one individual DE and
 * @ref computeIV(ArrayList, double, double, ArrayList) for several DEs. Note that
 * these methods merely compute an estimate, since computing an exact integral
 * is out of reach for this class.
 * 
 * Note that the MISE can only be computed in situations where either the ISB is
 * zero or the true density is known. In the first case, the IV is the same as
 * the MISE, of course. For the second case this class provides the possibility
 * to estimate the empirical MISE for a single DE via
 * @ref computeMISE(ContinuousDistribution, double[], double[][], double, double,
 * double[], double[], double[])} as well as for several DEs via
 * @ref computeMISE(ContinuousDistribution, double[], ArrayList, double, double,
 * ArrayList). 
 * Again, as explained before for the IV, this merely gives an estimate of the empirical MISE.
