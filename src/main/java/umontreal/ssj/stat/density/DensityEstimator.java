/**
 * This abstract class represents a univariate density estimator (DE).
 * 
 * In this abstract class, only non-static methods for evaluating the density
 * estimator are provided. However, typically, its subclasses offer static
 * methods as well. In a majority of cases, one simply wishes to estimate the
 * density at a finite set of evaluation points, from a given set of data, and
 * perhaps plot the estimated density. To do that, there is no need to create an
 * object. One can simply use a static `evalDensity` method followed by
 * `plotDensity`. Note that calling the `evalDensity` method only once for a
 * vector of evaluation points is typically much faster than calling it
 * separately for each evaluation point.
 * 
 * In case one plans to evaluate the same density several times with the same
 * data, it may be worthwhile to construct a `DensityEstimator` object and build
 * the density estimate from the given data. After that, one can evaluate the
 * density at any given point, often much faster than by calling the static
 * method. In the case of a histogram or average shifted histogram, for example,
 * constructing the density estimator takes time, but once it is constructed,
 * evaluating it is relatively fast. For a KDE with fixed bandwidth, the
 * difference (or gain) may be small.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * In a non-abstract subclass, it suffices (in principle) to implement the
 * abstract method @ref evalDensity(double), which evaluates the density at a
 * single point \f$x\f$ given the data points. However, other methods will
 * typically be overridden to make them more efficient. For example, evaluating
 * the DE over a set of evaluation points \f$\{x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{k-1}\} \f$
 * can often be performed more efficiently than by calling `evalDensity(x)`
 * repeatedly in a loop.
 * 
 * More precisely, the single point evaluation `evalDensity(double)` is
 * abstract, since it will definitely differ between subclasses. For the
 * evaluation on a set of points one can use `evalDensity(double[]).` Even
 * though a default implementation is provided, very often specific estimators
 * will have more efficient evaluation algorithms. So, overriding this method
 * can be beneficial in many cases. Furthermore, this class includes a method to
 * plot the estimated density.
 * 
 * Another important abstract method is `setData`, which allows to change the
 * observations that define the density estimator. This can be especially useful
 * when one intends to evaluate the same type of density estimator for different
 * observations.
 * 
 * This class also provides more elaborate methods that deal with the
 * convergence behavior of the DEs in terms of their IV, ISB, and MISE.
 * 
 * As these only require evaluations of the density estimator, they are
 * implemented as static methods.
 * 
 * One such method estimates the empirical IV, see `computeIV(double[][],
 * double, double, double[])` for one individual DE and `computeIV(ArrayList,
 * double, double, ArrayList)` for several DEs. These methods merely compute an
 * estimate, since computing an exact integral is out of reach for this class.
 * 
 * Note that the MISE can only be computed in situations where either the ISB is
 * zero or the true density is known. In the first case, the IV is the same as
 * the MISE, of course. For the second case this class provides the possibility
 * to estimate the empirical MISE for a single DE via
 * `computeMISE(ContinuousDistribution, double[], double[][], double, double,
 * double[], double[], double[])` as well as for several DEs via
 * `computeMISE(ContinuousDistribution, double[], ArrayList, double, double,
 * ArrayList)`. Again, as explained before for the IV, this merely gives an
 * estimate of the empirical MISE.
