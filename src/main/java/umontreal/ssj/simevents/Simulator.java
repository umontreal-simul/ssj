/**
 * Represents the executive of a discrete-event simulator. This class
 * maintains a simulation clock, an event list, and starts executing the
 * events in the appropriate order. Its methods permit one to start, stop,
 * and (re)initialize the simulation, and read the simulation clock.
 *
 * Usually, a simulation program uses a single simulation clock which is
 * represented by an instance of this class. For more convenience and
 * compatibility, this class therefore provides a mechanism to construct and
 * return a default simulator which is used when an event is constructed
 * without an explicit reference to a simulator, and when the simulator is
 * accessed through the  @ref Sim class.
 *
 * Note that this class is NOT thread-safe. Consequently, if a simulation
 * program uses multiple threads, it should acquire a lock on a simulator
 * (using a `synchronized` block) before accessing its state. Note however,
 * that one can launch many simulations in parallel with as many threads, as
 * long as *each thread has its own* `Simulator`.
