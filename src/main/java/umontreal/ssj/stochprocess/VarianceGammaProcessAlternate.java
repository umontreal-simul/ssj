/**
 * This is a @ref VarianceGammaProcess for which the successive random numbers
 * are used in a different order to generate the sample path.
 * The first one is used for the first generated value of the gamma process, 
 * the second one for the first generated value of the Brownian process, 
 * the third one for the second generated value of the gamma process,
 * the fourth one for the second value of the Brownian process, and so on.
 * Only the order in which the uniform random numbers are used in the method `generatePath` differs.
 * These numbers are generated at the beginning and then reordered.
 * This can make a difference when we use RQMC methods.
