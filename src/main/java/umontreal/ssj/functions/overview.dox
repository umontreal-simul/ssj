 * @package umontreal.ssj.functions
 *
 * Univariate functions as Java objects.
 *
 * This package contains a few utilities classes representing univariate
 * mathematical functions. They are useful, for example, when one wants to
 * pass an arbitrary function of one variable as argument to a method. They
 * allow one to apply mathematical operations like squaring, power, etc. on
 * generic functions. There are also utilities for numerical differentiation
 * and integration.
