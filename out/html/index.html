Introduction and overview</h1>
<p>SSJ (Stochastic Simulation in Java) is a Java library offering tools for stochastic (Monte Carlo) simulation <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sASM07a">[9]</a>, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLAW14a">[117]</a>. It provides basic facilities for random number generation with multiple streams and substreams, implements univariate and multivariate probability distributions and variate generators for them, functions to simulate certain types of stochastic processes, efficient event-list management tools for discrete-event simulation, support for an extensive collection of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods, statistical probes to collect data from simulation experiments, statistical estimation and goodness-of-fit methods, some tools to produce plots in LaTeX, and various other classes and methods that can be useful for simulation.</p>
<p>These tools are organized in a powerful and flexible system (or framework) of packages and classes. SSJ can be used to write simulation programs for stochastic models of various types of real-life systems, simple or very complex. It is also appropriate for implementing Monte Carlo methods for various types of applications.</p>
<p>For discrete-event simulation, commercial tools with drag-and-drop graphical interfaces such as <em>AnyLogic</em>, <em>Arena</em>, <em>Automod</em>, <em>ProModel</em>, <em>Simio</em>, <em>Simul8</em>, <em>Witness</em>, and many others, are widely used. Among their advantages, these tools do not require knowledge of a programming language, provide graphical animation, have automatic facilities to collect statistics and perform experiments, and can sometimes perform optimization to a certain extent. On the other hand, they are often too restrictive, because they are targeted at specific classes of models. With these tools, simulating a system whose logic is complicated or unconventional may become difficult. The graphical and automatic devices also tend to slow down the simulation significantly. Fast execution times are important for example in a context of optimization, where thousands of variants of a base system may have to be simulated, or for on-line applications where a fast response time is required.</p>
<p>SSJ, on the other hand, is very flexible and designed to facilitate efficient simulation modeling and programming in the Java language. A first version was described in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLEC02a">[131]</a> and <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLEC05a">[119]</a>&thinsp;. It is growing actively: new packages, classes, and methods are added regularly. It can be used freely by anyone and the source code is also freely available.</p>
<p>The facilities offered are grouped into different packages that are connected to each other. All the packages and classes have a detailed documentation produced by Doxygen. One may also want to look at the old .pdf manuals available at <a href="http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~simul/ssj-2/doc/pdf/">Old pdf doc</a>; they are out of date but contains more detailed explanations in some parts. (A detailed <code>.pdf</code> manual will be available in the future.)</p>
<p>There is also a tutorial guide that contains a set of commented-out examples of simulation programs, together with the Java code (see the Documentation section below). Some of these examples are taken from books such as <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLAW14a">[117]</a> and <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_fGLA04a">[67]</a>, for example. The best way to start learning SSJ is to study these examples and refer to the online detailed documentation when needed.</p>
<p>The packages currently offered are the following.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="REF_0_sec_02"></a>
Dependence on other libraries</h1>
<p>The following free third-party Java libraries are used in the implementation of some SSJ classes. See the SSJ installation instructions for how to install them on your computer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colt/">Colt library</a> , developed at the Centre Européen de Recherche Nucléaire (CERN) in Geneva <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_iHOS04a">[89]</a>&thinsp;, is a large library that provides a wide range of facilities for high performance scientific and technical computing in Java. SSJ uses the class DoubleArrayList from Colt in a few of its classes, namely in packages <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1stat.html">umontreal.ssj.stat</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1hups.html">umontreal.ssj.hups</a>. The reason is that this class provides a very efficient and convenient implementation of an (automatically) extensible array of <code>double</code>, together with several methods for computing statistics for the observations stored in the array (see, e.g., <code>Descriptive</code>). Using Colt was more efficient than using what was available in Java, at least when we decided to do that around 2002. <br />
The Colt library is distributed with the SSJ package as <b>colt.jar</b>.</p>
<p>The optimization package of Steve Verrill includes Java translations of the <a href="http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/Uncmin_f77/Minpack_f77.html">MINPACK</a> routines <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_iMOR80a">[94]</a>&thinsp; for nonlinear least squares problems as well as <a href="http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/Uncmin_f77/Uncmin_f77.html">UNCMIN</a> routines <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_iSCHa">[200]</a>&thinsp; for unconstrained optimization. They were translated from Fortran to Java by Steve Verrill at the USDA Forest Products Laboratory Madison, Wisconsin, USA, and are in the public domain. They are included in the SSJ distribution as the <b>optimization.jar</b> archive. It is used only in <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1probdist.html">umontreal.ssj.probdist</a> to compute maximum likelihood estimators. This archive also contains the <b>linear_algebra</b> library, based on public domain LINPACK routines, also translated from Fortran to Java by Steve Verrill.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/index.html">JFreeChart</a> is a free Java library that can generate a wide variety of charts and plots for use in applications, applets and servlets. <b>JFreeChart</b> currently supports, amongst others, bar charts, pie charts, line charts, XY-plots, histograms, scatter plots and time series plots. It is distributed with SSJ as <b>jfreechart-*.jar</b>. <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/index.php">JCommon</a> is a free general purpose Java library containing many useful classes used by JFreeChart and other Java packages. It is distributed with SSJ as <b>jcommon-*.jar</b>. JFreeChart (and JCommon) are used in the SSJ package <b>charts</b> to create different kinds of charts.</p>
<p>SSJ provides an interface to the <a href="http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/unuran/">UNURAN</a> library for nonuniform random number generation <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_iLEY02a">[157]</a>&thinsp;, in the <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1randvar.html">umontreal.ssj.randvar</a> package. UNURAN does not have to be installed to be used with SSJ, because it is linked statically with the appropriate SSJ native library. However, the UNURAN documentation will be required to take full advantage of the library.</p>
<p>The package <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1latnetbuilder.html">umontreal.ssj.latnetbuilder</a> provides an interface to <a href="http://umontreal-simul.github.io/latnetbuilder/">LatNet Builder</a> which is a C++ library and tool to construct highly-uniform point sets such as lattice rules, polynomial lattice rules, and digital nets in base 2. LatNet Builder must be installed to be able to use this package.</p>

Documentation</h1>
<p>The tutorial available in the scr/main/docs/examples/tutorial directory of this distribution is the best starting point to learn SSJ. It can be accessed by clicking "SSJ Introduction and Tutorial by Examples" in the "Related Pages" section of this Git distribution.</p>
<p>Every package introduced here contains its own reference documentation as a PDF file, in the <code>doc/pdf</code> subdirectory. This documentation describes in more details how to use the package and provides a description of each class and method.</p>
