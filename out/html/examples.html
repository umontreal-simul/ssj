<h1><a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_sec_01"></a>
Introduction</h1>
<p>The aim of this document is to provide an introduction to SSJ via a brief overview and a series of examples. The examples are collected in three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
those that need no event or process scheduling;  </li>
<li>
those based on the discrete-event simulation paradigm and implemented with an <em>event view</em> using the package <code>simevents</code>.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Sections&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_sec_simple">Some Elementary Examples</a> to <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_sec_event">Discrete-Event Simulation</a> of this guide correspond to these three groups. Some examples (e.g., the single-server queue) are carried across two or three sections to illustrate different ways of implementing the same model. The Java code of all these examples is available on-line from the SSJ web page (just type “SSJ iro” in Google).</p>
<p>While studying the examples, the reader can refer to the functional definitions (the APIs) of the SSJ classes and methods in the guides of the corresponding packages. Each package in SSJ has its own user’s guide in the form of a <code>.pdf</code> document that contains the detailed API and complete documentation, and starts with an overview of one or two pages. We strongly recommend reading each of these overviews. We also recommend to refer to the <code>.pdf</code> versions of the guides, because they contain a more detailed and complete documentation than the <code>.html</code> versions, which are better suited for quick on-line referencing for those who are already familiar with SSJ.</p>
<p>In Section&#160; REF_examples_sec_queue, we start with a very simple classical example: a single queue. We give different variants of this example, illustrating the mixture of processes and events. In Section&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_sec_preypred">Continuous simulation: A prey-predator system</a>, we give a small example of a deterministic continuous simulation. In Sections&#160; REF_examples_sec_jobshop and REF_examples_sec_timeshared, we give examples of a job shop model and a time-shared computer model, adapted from <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLAW00a">[111]</a>&thinsp;. A queuing model of a bank, taken from <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sBRA87a">[24]</a>&thinsp;, is programmed in Section&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_sec_bank">A simplified bank</a>, with both the process and event views. In Section&#160; REF_examples_sec_visits, we simulate a model of guided tours for groups of people, where the process synchronization is slightly more complicated than for the earlier models. In Section&#160; REF_examples_sec_ingots, we give an example of a mixed discrete-continuous simulation. In Section&#160; REF_examples_sec_robot, we give a more elaborate example, for a model discussed in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLEC91a">[124]</a>&thinsp;, where a robot maintains a series of machines subject to random failures. It illustrates the idea of modular design.</p>

Overview of SSJ</h1>
<p>SSJ is an organized set of packages whose purpose is to facilitate stochastic simulation programming in the Java language. The facilities offered are grouped into different packages, each one having its own user’s guide as a <code>.pdf</code> file. This is the official documentation. There is also a simplified on-line documentation in HTML format, produced via <code>javadoc</code>. Early descriptions of SSJ are given in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLEC02a">[125]</a>, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLEC05a">[113]</a>&thinsp;. Some of the tools can also be used for modeling (e.g., selecting and fitting distributions). SSJ is still growing actively. New packages, classes, and methods will be added in forthcoming years and others will be refined.</p>
<p>The packages currently offered are the following:</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_sec_03"></a>
Dependence on other libraries</h2>
<p>SSJ uses some classes from other free Java libraries.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colt/">Colt library</a> , developed at the Centre Européen de Recherche Nucléaire (CERN) in Geneva <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_iHOS04a">[86]</a>&thinsp;, is a large library that provides a wide range of facilities for high performance scientific and technical computing in Java. SSJ uses the class DoubleArrayList from Colt in a few of its classes, namely in packages <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1stat.html">umontreal::ssj::stat</a> and <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1hups.html">umontreal::ssj::hups</a>. The reason is that this class provides a very efficient and convenient implementation of an (automatically) extensible array of <code>double</code>, together with several methods for computing statistics for the observations stored in the array (see, e.g., <code>Descriptive</code>). The Colt library is distributed with the SSJ package as <b>colt.jar</b>. It must be added in the CLASSPATH environment variable.</p>
<p>The <b>linear_algebra</b> library is based on public domain LINPACK routines. They were translated from Fortran to Java by Steve Verrill at the USDA Forest Products Laboratory Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The optimization package of Steve Verrill includes Java translations of the <a href="http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/Uncmin_f77/Minpack_f77.html">MINPACK</a> routines <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_iMOR80a">[89]</a>&thinsp; for nonlinear least squares problems as well as <a href="http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/Uncmin_f77/Uncmin_f77.html">UNCMIN</a> routines <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_iSCHa">[187]</a>&thinsp; for unconstrained optimization. They were translated from Fortran to Java by Steve Verrill and are in the public domain. They are included in the SSJ distribution as the <b>optimization.jar</b> archive. It is used only in the <code>probdist</code> package to compute maximum likelihood estimators.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/index.html">JFreeChart</a> is a free Java library that can generate a wide variety of charts and plots for use in applications, applets and servlets. <b>JFreeChart</b> currently supports, amongst others, bar charts, pie charts, line charts, XY-plots, histograms, scatter plots and time series plots. It is distributed with SSJ as <b>jfreechart-*.jar</b>. <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/index.php">JCommon</a> is a free general purpose Java library containing many useful classes used by JFreeChart and other Java packages. It is distributed with SSJ as <b>jcommon-*.jar</b>. JFreeChart (and JCommon) are used in the SSJ package <b>charts</b> to create different kinds of charts.</p>
<p>SSJ also provides an interface to the <a href="http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/unuran/">UNURAN</a> library for nonuniform random number generation <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_iLEY02a">[144]</a>&thinsp;, in the <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1randvar.html">umontreal::ssj::randvar</a> package. UNURAN does not have to be installed to be used with SSJ, because it is linked statically with the appropriate SSJ native library. However, the UNURAN documentation will be required to take full advantage of the library.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_sec_04"></a>
random number generation</h2>
<p>Random numbers feed simulation models and allow one to compute statistics. To generate random numbers from any probability distribution, uniform random numbers are required. Such numbers are uniformly distributed in the \([0,1)\) interval, i.e., the probability of getting a given number \(x\) in that interval is the same for all values of \(x\in[0,1)\). Any generated number \(x\) is also independent from any previous or future generated numbers. Although the generated uniforms are not truly independent since one uniform is obtained from the previous uniforms by a mathematical formula, one can consider them independent for simulation purposes. Selection of a random number generator is based on several criteria such as uniformity, performance, and portability <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_rLEC01d">[135]</a>&thinsp;. The package <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1rng.html">umontreal::ssj::rng</a> contains the needed tools to generate such numbers. It defines an interface called <a class="el" href="interfaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1rng_1_1RandomStream.html">umontreal.ssj.rng.RandomStream</a> implemented by any random number generator supported by SSJ. This interface allows one to easily interchange random number generators since they are accessed through the same set of methods specified by the interface. Only the random number generator setup depends on the type of generator that was chosen.</p>
<p>If one wants to replace uniform random numbers with low-discrepancy point sets for variance reduction, the package <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1hups.html">umontreal::ssj::hups</a> contains all the necessary facilities. Such highly uniform point sets all inherit from the <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1hups_1_1PointSet.html">umontreal.ssj.hups.PointSet</a> which provides a <a class="el" href="interfaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1hups_1_1PointSetIterator.html">umontreal.ssj.hups.PointSetIterator</a> extending <a class="el" href="interfaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1rng_1_1RandomStream.html">umontreal.ssj.rng.RandomStream</a>. The replacement can be easily done without modifying the model implementation, except the setup-time code.</p>
<p>To generate non-uniform random numbers, one must select a probability distribution based on the empirical data <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLAW00a">[111]</a>&thinsp;. SSJ does not provide probability distribution estimation tools, but goodness of fit tests are included to help in model validation. The package <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1probdist.html">umontreal::ssj::probdist</a> contains several standard, commonly-used, probability distributions. It supports discrete and continuous distributions through two different abstract base classes: <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1probdist_1_1ContinuousDistribution.html">umontreal.ssj.probdist.ContinuousDistribution</a> and <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1probdist_1_1DiscreteDistribution.html">umontreal.ssj.probdist.DiscreteDistribution</a>, respectively. Again, since the distributions inherit from a common class, their access can be independent from the selected distribution, except for the setup case. One can compute the density/mass, distribution, complementary, and inverse distribution functions. These facilities are also accessible through static methods implemented in each distribution class if one does not want to create objects or needs distributions whose parameters vary in time. However, setup-time operations must be performed for each operation, which can be inefficient for certain distributions.</p>
<p>To generate non-uniform random numbers, the packages <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1rng.html">umontreal::ssj::rng</a> (or <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1hups.html">umontreal::ssj::hups</a> ) and <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1probdist.html">umontreal::ssj::probdist</a> must be used together. The simplest generation method is to generate a uniform random number using a generator implementing <a class="el" href="interfaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1rng_1_1RandomStream.html">umontreal.ssj.rng.RandomStream</a> (or get a coordinate using a point set iterator) and to apply inversion by using the selected <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1probdist.html">umontreal::ssj::probdist</a> distribution’s <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1probdist_1_1ContinuousDistribution.html#a47dfe73ca7d2e4a8bf34bc96af34530a" title="Returns the inverse distribution function . ">umontreal.ssj.probdist.ContinuousDistribution.inverseF</a> method. However, inversion is not the only generation method and sometimes not the most efficient. For some distributions, closed-form inverse functions or fast inversion algorithms exist. For others, inversion is performed using binary or even linear search. In such cases, the performance and precision depends on the complexity of the distribution function which is calculated several times for one inverse. The package <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1randvar.html">umontreal::ssj::randvar</a> acts as glue between uniform random number generators and probability distributions. Continuous or discrete random number generators also inherits from common base classes, namely <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1randvar_1_1RandomVariateGen.html">umontreal.ssj.randvar.RandomVariateGen</a> and <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1randvar_1_1RandomVariateGenInt.html">umontreal.ssj.randvar.RandomVariateGenInt</a>. All generators use a random stream and a probability distribution for their construction. As opposed to <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1probdist.html">umontreal::ssj::probdist</a>, one can directly instantiate <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1randvar_1_1RandomVariateGen.html">umontreal.ssj.randvar.RandomVariateGen</a> or <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1randvar_1_1RandomVariateGenInt.html">umontreal.ssj.randvar.RandomVariateGenInt</a>. However, in such cases, only inversion generation method will be available. To use an alternate generation method, one must instantiate a specialized generator class and switch to the given generation algorithm using an object method. Each specialized class also provides static method which perform the same action. Although they allow one to avoid object creation, their signatures are specific to the used distribution and they have to perform setup-time operations on each variate generation, which can become inefficient. The <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1randvar.html">umontreal::ssj::randvar</a> package also provides the class umontreal.ssj.randvar.RandomVariateTrans to apply transformations to a generator. This allows, for example, to generate variates from a truncated distribution.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_sec_05"></a>
Performing simulation</h2>
<p>SSJ supports discrete-event, process-driven, continuous or mixed simulation. The discrete-event and continuous simulation are managed by the package <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1simevents.html">umontreal::ssj::simevents</a>. This package manages the simulation clock and the event list, two essential components for all discrete-event simulations. The simulation clock tracks the simulation time whereas the event list stores the scheduled events to execute them in the right order. Events are user-defined subclasses of <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1simevents_1_1Event.html">umontreal.ssj.simevents.Event</a>. When an event occurs, any type of actions can then be taken. The package provides a class called umontreal.ssj.simevents.List which implements a linked list supporting statistical collection. Continuous simulation can be performed using the class <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1simevents_1_1Continuous.html">umontreal.ssj.simevents.Continuous</a>. It uses the event framework to resolve differential equations numerically at fixed steps in the simulation time.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_sec_06"></a>
Other tools</h2>
<p>The package <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1stat.html">umontreal::ssj::stat</a> provides basic tools for statistical collection. Statistics are collected using statistical probes, i.e, objects implementing the abstract class <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1stat_1_1StatProbe.html">umontreal.ssj.stat.StatProbe</a>. Two types of probes are supported. The <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1stat_1_1Tally.html">umontreal.ssj.stat.Tally</a> allows to collect observations of the form \(X_1,…,X_n\) whereas <a class="el" href="classumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1simevents_1_1Accumulate.html">umontreal.ssj.simevents.Accumulate</a> collects statistics for a continuous variable evolving in simulation time. During the simulation, one can add observations to such probes. After the simulation, measures can be obtained, such as sample average, sample standard deviation or confidence interval. A statistical report can be obtained for all probes. The package also provides a way to detach statistical collection from the model implementation by using bound properties.</p>
<p>To test a proposed model against empirical data, goodness of fit tests are provided in the package <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1gof.html">umontreal::ssj::gof</a>. Such tests, e.g. Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Anderson-Darling, compute a statistic using the empirical observations and the proposed distribution. The empirical observations are given as an array whereas the distribution is given as a <a class="el" href="namespaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1probdist.html">umontreal::ssj::probdist</a> object. From the computed statistic, it is possible to compute the \(p\)-value which is useful to evaluate the significance of the test.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_sec_07"></a>
Related documentation</h2>
<p>The <code>example.pdf</code> file, in the <code>doc/pdf</code> subdirectory of the SSJ distribution, explains simulation examples implemented using SSJ. This may be the best starting point to learn SSJ. Every package introduced here contains its own reference documentation as a PDF file, in the <code>doc/pdf</code> subdirectory. This documentation describes in more details how to use the package and provides a description of each class and method.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_sec_simple"></a>
Some Elementary Examples</h1>
<p>We start with elementary examples that illustrate how to generate uniform and nonuniform random numbers, construct probability distributions, collect elementary statistics, and compute confidence intervals, compare similar systems, and use randomized quasi-Monte Carlo point sets, with SSJ.</p>
<p>The models considered here are quite simple and some of the performance measures can be computed by (more accurate) numerical methods rather than by simulation. The fact that we use these models to give a first tasting of SSJ should not be interpreted to mean that simulation is necessarily the best tool for them.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_sec_collision"></a>
Collisions in a hashing system</h2>
<p>We want to estimate the expected number of collisions in a hashing system. There are \(k\) locations (or addresses) and \(m\) distinct items. Each item is assigned a random location, independently of the other items. A <em>collision</em> occurs each time an item is assigned a location already occupied. Let \(C\) be the number of collisions. We want to estimate \(\mathbb E[C]\), the expected number of collisions, by simulation. A theoretical result states that when \(k\to\infty\) while \(\lambda= m^2/(2k)\) is fixed, \(C\) converges in distribution to a Poisson random variable with mean \(\lambda\). For finite values of \(k\) and \(m\), we may want to approximate the distribution of \(C\) by the Poisson distribution with mean \(\lambda\), and use Monte Carlo simulation to assess the quality of this approximation. To do that, we can generate \(n\) independent realizations of \(C\), say \(C_1,…,C_n\), compute their empirical distribution and empirical mean, and compare with the Poisson distribution.</p>
<p>The Java program in Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_Collision">Collision</a> simulates \(C_1,…,C_n\) and computes a 95% confidence interval on \(\mathbb E[C]\). The results for \(k = 10000\), \(m = 500\), and \(n = 100000\), are in Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_res_Collision">Collision</a>. The reported confidence interval is \((12.25,  12.29)\), whereas \(\lambda= 12.5\). This indicates that the asymptotic result underestimates \(\mathbb E[C]\) by nearly 2%.</p>
<p>The Java program imports the SSJ packages <code>rng</code> and <code>stat</code>. It uses only two types of objects from SSJ: a <code>RandomStream</code> object, defined in the <code>rng</code> package, that generates a stream of independent random numbers from the uniform distribution, and a <code>Tally</code> object, from the <code>stat</code> package, to collect statistical observations and produce the report. In SSJ, <code>RandomStream</code> is actually just an interface that specifies all the methods that must be provided by its different implementations, which correspond to different brands of random streams (i.e., different types of uniform random number generators). The class <code>MRG32k3a</code>, whose constructor is invoked in the main program, is one such implementation of <code>RandomStream</code>. This is the one we use here. The class <code>Tally</code> provides the simplest type of statistical collector. It receives observations one by one, and after each new observation, it updates the number, average, variance, minimum, and maximum of the observations. At any time, it can return these statistics or compute a confidence interval for the theoretical mean of these observations, assuming that they are independent and identically distributed with the normal distribution. Other types of collectors that memorize the observations are also available in SSJ.</p>

Nonuniform variate generation and simple quantile estimates</h2>
<p>The program of Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_Nonuniform">Nonuniform</a> simulates the following artificial model. Define the random variable </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ X = Y_1 + \cdots+ Y_N + W_1 + …+ W_M, \]
</p>
<p> where \(N\) is Poisson with mean \(\lambda\), \(M\) is geometric with parameter \(p\), the \(Y_j\)’s are gamma with parameters \((\alpha, \beta)\), the \(W_j\)’s are lognormal with parameters \((\mu,\sigma)\), and all these random variables are independent. We want to generate \(n\) copies of \(X\), say \(X_1,…,X_n\), and estimate the 0.10, 0.50, 0.90, and 0.99 quantiles of the distribution of \(X\), simply from the quantiles of the empirical distribution.</p>
<p>The method <code>simulateRuns</code> generates \(n\) copies of \(X\) and pass them to a statistical collector of class <code>TallyStore</code>, that stores the individual observations. These observations are sorted in increasing order by invoking <code>quickSort</code>, and the appropriate empirical quantiles are printed, together with a short report.</p>

This is simpler, but not recommended in general because it does not permit one to perform experiments with different parameter sets in a single program. Passing the parameters to the constructor as in Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_Collision">Collision</a> would require more lines of code, but would provide more flexibility.</p>
<p>The class initialization also constructs a <code>RandomStream</code> of type <code>LFSR113</code> (this is a faster uniform generator that <code>MRG32k3a</code>), used to generate all the random numbers. For the generation of \(N\), we construct a Poisson distribution with mean \(\lambda\) (without giving it a name), and pass it together with the random stream to the constructor of class <code>PoissonGen</code>. The returned object <code>genN</code> is random number generator that generate Poisson random variables with mean \(\lambda\), via inversion. As similar procedure is used to construct <code>genY</code> and <code>genW</code>, which generate gamma and lognormal random variates, respectively. Note that a <code>RandomVariateGenInt</code> produces integer-valued random variates, while a <code>RandomVariateGen</code> produces real-valued random variates. For the gamma distribution, we use a special type of random number generator based on a rejection method, which is faster than inversion. These constructors precompute some (hidden) constants once for all, to speedup the random variate generation. For the Poisson distribution with mean \(\lambda\), the constructor of <code>PoissonDist</code> actually precomputes the distribution function in a table, and uses this table to compute the inverse distribution function each time a Poisson random variate needs to be generated with this particular distribution. This is possible because all Poisson random variates have the same parameter \(\lambda\). If a different \(\lambda\) was used for each variate, then we would use the static method of <code>PoissonDist</code> instead of constructing a Poisson distribution, otherwise we would have to reconstruct the distribution each time. The static method reconstructs part of the table each time, with the given \(\lambda\), so it is slower if we want to generate several Poisson variates with the same \(\lambda\). As an illustration, we use the static method to generate the geometric random variates (in <code>generateX</code>), instead of constructing a geometric distribution and variate generator. To generate \(M\), we invoke the static method <code>inverseF</code> of the class <code>GeometricDist</code>, which evaluates the inverse geometric distribution function for a given parameter \(p\) and a given uniform random variate.</p>
<p>The results of this program, with \(n = 10000\), are in Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_res_Nonuniform">Nonuniform</a>. We see that \(X\) has a coefficient of variation larger than 1, and the quantiles indicate that the distribution is skewed, with a long thick tail to the right. We have \(X &lt; 553\) about half the time, but values over several thousands are not uncommon. This probably happens when \(N\) or \(M\) takes a large value. There are also cases where \(N=M=0\), in which case \(X=0\).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_sec_inventory"></a>
A discrete-time inventory system</h2>
<p>Consider a simple inventory system where the demands for a given product on successive days are independent Poisson random variables with mean \(\lambda\). If \(X_j\) is the stock level at the beginning of day \(j\) and \(D_j\) is the demand on that day, then there are \(\min(D_j, X_j)\) sales, \(\max(0, D_j - X_j)\) lost sales, and the stock at the end of the day is \(Y_j = \max(0, X_j - D_j)\). There is a revenue \(c\) for each sale and a cost \(h\) for each unsold item at the end of the day. The inventory is controlled using a \((s,S)\) policy: If \(Y_j &lt; s\), order \(S - Y_j\) items, otherwise do not order. When an order is made in the evening, with probability \(p\) it arrives during the night and can be used for the next day, and with probability \(1-p\) it never arrives (in which case a new order will have to be made the next evening). When the order arrives, there is a fixed cost \(K\) plus a marginal cost of \(k\) per item. The stock at the beginning of the first day is \(X_0 = S\).</p>
<p>We want to simulate this system for \(m\) days, for a given set of parameters and a given control policy \((s,S)\), and replicate this simulation \(n\) times independently to estimate the expected profit per day over a time horizon of \(m\) days. Eventually, we might want to <em>optimize</em> the values of the decision parameters \((s,S)\) via simulation, but we do not do that here. (In practice, this is usually done for more complicated models.)</p>

<a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_Inventory">Inventory</a> gives a Java program, based on the SSJ library, that performs the required simulation for \(n=500\), \(m=2000\), \(s=80\), \(S=200\), \(\lambda=100\), \(c=2\), \(h=0.1\), \(K=10\), \(k=1\), and \(p=0.95\).</p>
<p>The <code>import</code> statements at the beginning of the program retrieve the SSJ packages/classes that are needed. The <code>Inventory</code> class has a constructor that initializes the model parameters (saving their values in class variables) and constructs the required random number generators and the statistical collector. To generate the demands \(D_j\) on successive days, we create (in the last line of the constructor) a random number stream and a Poisson distribution with mean \(\lambda\), and then a Poisson random variate generator <code>genDemand</code> that uses this stream and this distribution. This mechanism will (automatically) precompute tables to ensure that the Poisson variate generation is efficient. This can be done because the value of \(\lambda\) does not change during the simulation. The random number stream <code>streamOrder</code>, used to decide which orders are received, and the statistical collector <code>statProfit</code>, are also created when the <code>Inventory</code> constructor is invoked. The code that invokes their constructors is outside the <code>Inventory</code> constructor, but it could have been inside as well. On the other hand, <code>genDemand</code> must be constructed inside the <code>Inventory</code> constructor, because the value of \(\lambda\) is not yet defined outside. The <em>random number streams</em> can be viewed as virtual random number generators that generate random numbers in the interval \([0,1)\) according to the uniform probability distribution.</p>
<p>The method <code>simulateOneRun</code> simulates the system for \(m\) days, with a given policy, and returns the average profit per day. For each day, we generate the demand \(D_j\), compute the stock \(Y_j\) at the end of the day, and add the sales revenues minus the leftover inventory costs to the profit. If \(Y_j &lt; s\), we generate a uniform random variable \(U\) over the interval \((0,1)\) and an order of size \(S - Y_j\) is received the next morning if \(U &lt; p\) (that is, with probability \(p\)). In case of a successful order, we pay for it and the stock level is reset to \(S\).</p>
<p>The method <code>simulateRuns</code> performs \(n\) independent simulation runs of this system and returns a report that contains a 90% confidence interval for the expected profit. The main program constructs an <code>Inventory</code> object with the desired parameters, asks for \(n\) simulation runs, and prints the report. It also creates a timer that computes the total CPU time to execute the program, and prints it. The results are in Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_res_Inventory">Inventory</a>. The average profit per day is approximately 85. It took 0.39 seconds (on a 2.4 GHz computer running Linux) to simulate the system for 2000 days, compute the statistics, and print the results.</p>

These \(n\) differences are tallied in statistical collector <code>statDiff</code>, to estimate the expected difference in average daily profits between the two policies.</p>
<p>The method <code>simulateDiffCRN</code> does the same, but using <em>common random numbers</em> across pairs of simulation runs. After running the simulation with policy \((s_1, S_1)\), the two random number streams are reset to the start of their current substream, so that they produce exactly the same sequence of random numbers when the simulation is run with policy \((s_2, S_2)\). Then the difference in profits is given to the statistical collector <code>statDiff</code> as before and the two streams are reset to a new substream for the next pair of simulations.</p>
<p>Why not use the same stream for both the demands and orders? In this example, we need one random number to generate the demand each day, and also one random number to know if the order arrives, but only on the days where we make an order. These days where we make an order are not necessarily the same for the two policies. So if we use a single stream for both the demands and orders, the random numbers will not necessarily be used for the same purpose across the two policies: a random number used to decide if the order arrives in one case may end up being used to generate a demand in the other case. This can greatly diminish the power of the common random numbers technology. Using two different streams as in Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_InventoryCRN">InventoryCRN</a> ensures at least that the random numbers are used for the same purpose for the two policies. For more explanations and examples about common random numbers, see <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLAW00a">[111]</a>, <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLEC09a">[119]</a>&thinsp;.</p>
<p>The main program estimates the expected difference in average daily profits for policies \((s_1, S_1) = (80, 198)\) and \((s_2, S_2) = (80, 200)\), first with independent random numbers, then with common random numbers. The other parameters are the same as before. The results are in Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_res_InventoryCRN">InventoryCRN</a>. We see that use of common random numbers reduces the variance by a factor of approximately 19 in this case.</p>

A single-server queue with Lindley’s recurrence</h2>
<p>We consider here a <em>single-server queue</em>, where customers arrive randomly and are served one by one in their order of arrival, i.e., <em>first in, first out</em> (FIFO). We suppose that the times between successive arrivals are exponential random variables with mean \(1/\lambda\), that the service times are exponential random variables with mean \(1/\mu\), and that all these random variables are mutually independent. The customers arriving while the server is busy must join the queue. The system initially starts empty. We want to simulate the first \(m\) customers in the system and compute the mean waiting time per customer.</p>
<p>This simple model is well-known in queuing theory: It is called an \(M/M/1\) queue. Simple formulas are available for this model to compute the average waiting time per customer, average queue length, etc., over an <em>infinite</em> time horizon <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_pKLE75a">[102]</a>&thinsp;. For a finite number of customers or a finite time horizon, these expectations can also be computed by numerical methods, but here we just want to show how it can be simulated.</p>
<p>In a single-server queue, if \(W_i\) and \(S_i\) are the waiting time and service time of the \(i\)th customer, and \(A_i\) is the time between the arrivals of the \(i\)th and \((i+1)\)th customers, we have \(W_1=0\) and the \(W_i\)’s follow the recurrence <a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_examples_eq_lindley"></a> </p><p class="formulaDsp">

Using the observer design pattern</h2>
<p>Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_QueueObs">QueueObs</a> adds a few ingredients to the program <code>QueueLindley</code>, in order to illustrate the <em>observer</em> design pattern implemented in package <code>stat</code>. This mechanism permits one to separate data generation from data processing. It can be very helpful in large simulation programs or libraries, where different objects may need to process the same data in different ways. These objects may have the task of storing observations or displaying statistics in different formats, for example, and they are not necessarily fixed in advance.</p>
<p>The <em>observer</em> pattern, supported by the <a class="el" href="interfaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1stat_1_1ObservationListener.html">umontreal.ssj.stat.ObservationListener</a> interface in SSJ, offers the appropriate flexibility for that kind of situation. A statistical probe maintains a list of registered <a class="el" href="interfaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1stat_1_1ObservationListener.html">umontreal.ssj.stat.ObservationListener</a> objects, and broadcasts information to all its registered observers whenever appropriate. Any object that implements the interface <a class="el" href="interfaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1stat_1_1ObservationListener.html">umontreal.ssj.stat.ObservationListener</a> can register as an observer.</p>
<p><code>StatProbe</code> in package <code>stat</code>, as well as its subclasses <code>Tally</code> and <code>Accumulate</code>, contains a list of <code>ObservationListener</code>’s. Whenever they receive a new statistical observation, e.g., via <code>Tally.add</code> or <code>Accumulate.update</code>, they send the new value to all registered observers. To register as an observer, an object must implement the interface <a class="el" href="interfaceumontreal_1_1ssj_1_1stat_1_1ObservationListener.html">umontreal.ssj.stat.ObservationListener</a> This implies that it must provide an implementation of the method <code>newObservation</code>, whose purpose is to recover the information that the object has registered for.</p>
<p>In the example, the statistical collector <code>waitingTimes</code> transmits to all its registered listeners each new statistical observation that it receives via its <code>add</code> method. More specifically, each call to <code>waitingTimes.add(x)</code> generates in the background a call to <code>o.newObservation(waitingTimes, x)</code> for all registered observers <code>o</code>.</p>
<p>The method <code>notifyObs</code> is used to turn the tally into such an agency. In fact, the collector is both a tally and a distribution agency, but its tally functionality can be disabled using the <code>stopCollectStat</code> method. This can be useful when the registered observers already perform statistical collection.</p>
<p>Two observers register to receive observations from <code>waitingTimes</code> in the example. They are anonymous objects of classes <code>ObservationTrace</code> and <code>LargeWaitsCollector</code>, respectively. Each one is informed of any new observation \(W_i\) via its <code>newObservation</code> method. The task of the <code>ObservationTrace</code> observer is to print the waiting times \(W_5\), \(W_{10}\), \(W_{15}\), …, whereas the <code>LargeWaitsCollector</code> observer stores in an array all waiting times that exceed 2. The statistical collector <code>waitingTimes</code> itself also stores appropriate information to be able to provide a statistical report when required.</p>
<p>The <code>ObservationListener</code> interface specifies that <code>newObservation</code> must have two formal parameters, of classes <code>StatProbe</code> and <code>double</code>, respectively. The second parameter is the value of the observation. In the case where the observer registers to several <code>ObservationListener</code> objects, the first parameter of <code>newObservation</code> tells it which one is sending the information, so it can adopt the correct behavior for this sender.</p>

<p>A <em>geometric Brownian motion</em> (GBM) \(\{S(\zeta), \zeta\ge0\}\) satisfies </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ S(\zeta) = S(0) \exp\left[(r - \sigma^2/2)\zeta+ \sigma B(\zeta)\right] \]
</p>
<p> where \(r\) is the <em>risk-free appreciation rate</em>, \(\sigma\) is the <em>volatility parameter</em>, and \(B\) is a standard Brownian motion, i.e., a stochastic process whose increments over disjoint intervals are independent normal random variables, with mean 0 and variance \(\delta\) over an interval of length \(\delta\) (see, e.g., <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_fGLA04a">[64]</a>&thinsp;). The GBM process is a popular model for the evolution in time of the market price of financial assets. A discretely-monitored <em>Asian option</em> on the arithmetic average of a given asset has discounted payoff <a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_examples_eq_payasian"></a> </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ \tag{payasian} X = e^{-rT} \max[\bar{S} - K,  0] \]
</p>
<p> where \(K\) is a constant called the <em>strike price</em> and <a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_examples_eq_arithmetic_average"></a> </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ \tag{arithmetic-average} \bar{S} = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{j=1}^t S(\zeta_j), \]
</p>
<p> for some fixed observation times \(0 &lt; \zeta_1 &lt; \cdots&lt; \zeta_t = T\). The value (or fair price) of the Asian option is \(c = E[X]\) where the expectation is taken under the so-called risk-neutral measure (which means that the parameters \(r\) and \(\sigma\) have to be selected in a particular way; see <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_fGLA04a">[64]</a>&thinsp;).</p>
<p>This value \(c\) can be estimated by simulation as follows. Generate \(t\) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) \(N(0,1)\) random variables \(Z_1,…,Z_t\) and put \(B(\zeta_j) = B(\zeta_{j-1}) + \sqrt{\zeta_j - \zeta_{j-1}} Z_j\), for \(j=1,…,t\), where \(B(\zeta_0) = \zeta_0 = 0\). Then, <a class="anchor" id="REF_examples_examples_eq_Szetaj"></a> </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ S(\zeta_j) = S(0) e^{(r-\sigma^2/2)\zeta_j + \sigma B(\zeta_j)} = S(\zeta_{j-1}) e^{(r-\sigma^2/2)(\zeta_j-\zeta_{j-1}) + \sigma\sqrt{\zeta_j - \zeta_{j-1}} Z_j} \tag{Szetaj} \]
</p>
<p> for \(j = 1,…,t\) and the payoff can be computed via ( <a class="el" href="">payasian</a> ). This can be replicated \(n\) times, independently, and the option value is estimated by the average discounted payoff. The Java program of Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_Asian">Asian</a> implement this procedure.</p>
<p>Note that generating the sample path and computing the payoff is done in two different methods. This way, other methods could eventually be added to compute payoffs that are defined differently (e.g., based on the geometric average, or with barriers, etc.) over the same generated sample path.</p>

These point set iterators, available for each type of point set in package <code>hups</code>, implement the <code>RandomStream</code> interface and permit one to easily replace the uniform random numbers by (randomized) highly-uniform point sets or sequences, without changing the code of the model itself. The method <code>resetStartStream</code>, invoked immediately after each randomization, resets the iterator to the first coordinate of the first point of the point set <code>p</code>. The number \(n\) of simulation runs is equal to the number of points. The points correspond to substreams in the <code>RandomStream</code> interface. The method <code>resetNextSubstream</code>, invoked after each simulation run in <code>simulateRuns</code>, resets the iterator to the first coordinate of the next point. Each generation of a uniform random number (directly or indirectly) with this stream during the simulation moves the iterator to the next coordinate of the current point.</p>
<p>The point set used in this example is a <em>Sobol’ net</em> with \(n = 2^{16}\) points in \(t\) dimensions. The <code>main</code> program passes this point set to <code>simulateQMC</code> and asks for \(m=20\) independent randomizations. It then computes the empirical variance and CPU time <em>per simulation run</em> for both MC and randomized QMC. It prints the ratio of variances, which can be interpreted as the estimated <em>variance reduction factor</em> obtained when using QMC instead of MC in this example, and the ratio of efficiencies, which can be interpreted as the estimated <em>efficiency improvement factor</em>. (The efficiency of an estimator is defined as 1/(variance \(\times\) CPU time per run.) The results are in Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_res_AsianQMC">AsianQMC</a>: QMC reduces the variance by a factor of around 250 and improves the efficiency by a factor of over 500. Randomized QMC not only reduces the variance, it also runs faster than MC. The main reason for this is the call to <code>resetNextSubstream</code> in <code>simulateRuns</code>, which is rather costly for a random number stream of class <code>MRG32k3a</code> (with the current implementation) and takes negligible time for an iterator over a digital net in base 2. In fact, in the the case of MC, the call to <code>resetNextSubstream</code> is not really needed. Removing it for that case reduces the CPU time by more than 40%.</p>

<a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_QueueEv">QueueEv</a> gives an event-oriented simulation program, where a subclass of the class <code>Event</code> is defined for each type of event that can occur in the simulation: arrival of a customer (<code>Arrival</code>), departure of a customer (<code>Departure</code>), and end of the simulation (<code>EndOfSim</code>). Each event <em>instance</em> is inserted into the <em>event list</em> upon its creation, with a scheduled time of occurrence, and is <em>executed</em> when the simulation clock reaches this time. Executing an event means invoking its <code>actions</code> method. Each event subclass must implement this method. The simulation clock and the event list (i.e., the list of events scheduled to occur in the future) are maintained behind the scenes by the class <code>Sim</code> of package <code>simevents</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>QueueEv</code> is instantiated by the <code>main</code> method, the program creates two streams of random numbers, two random variate generators, two lists, and two statistical probes (or collectors). The random number streams are attached to random variate generators <code>genArr</code> and <code>genServ</code> which are used to generate the times between successive arrivals and the service times, respectively. We can use such an attached generator because the means (parameters) do not change during simulation. The lists <code>waitList</code> and <code>servList</code> contain the customers waiting in the queue and the customer in service (if any), respectively. Maintaining a list for the customer in service may seem exaggerated, because this list never contains more than one object, but the current design has the advantage of working with very little change if the queuing model has more than one server, and in other more general situations. Note that we could have used the class <code>LinkedListStat</code> from package <code>simevents</code> instead of <code>java.util.LinkedList</code>. However, with our current implementation, the automatic statistical collection in that <code>LinkedListStat</code> class would not count the customers whose waiting time is zero, because they are never placed in the list. Here we use the class <code>List</code> from package <code>simevents</code>. This class is equivalent to the standard class <code>java.util.LinkedList</code>, except that its implementation is more efficient than the current one in JDK and it can also collect statistics automatically. However, the automatic statistical collection on <code>waitList</code> would not count the customers whose waiting time is zero, because they are never placed in this list, so we do not use this facility.</p>
<p>The statistical probe <code>custWaits</code> collects statistics on the customer’s waiting times. It is of the class <code>Tally</code>, which is appropriate when the statistical data of interest is a sequence of observations \(X_1, X_2, …\) of which we might want to compute the sample mean, variance, and so on. A new observation is given to this probe by the <code>add</code> method each time a customer starts its service. Every <code>add</code> to a <code>Tally</code> probe brings a new observation \(X_i\), which corresponds here to a customer’s waiting time in the queue. The other statistical probe, <code>totWait</code>, is of the class <code>Accumulate</code>, which means that it computes the integral (and, eventually, the time-average) of a continuous-time stochastic process with piecewise-constant trajectory. Here, the stochastic process of interest is the length of the queue as a function of time. One must call <code>totWait.update</code> whenever there is a change in the queue size, to update the (hidden) <em>accumulator</em> that keeps the current value of the integral of the queue length. This integral is equal, after each update, to the total waiting time in the queue, for all the customers, since the beginning of the simulation.</p>
<p>Each customer is an object with two fields: <code>arrivTime</code> memorizes this customer’s arrival time to the system, and <code>servTime</code> memorizes its service time. This object is created, and its fields are initialized, when the customer arrives.</p>
<p>The method <code>simulateOneRun</code> simulates this system for a fixed time horizon. It first invokes <code>Sim.init</code>, which initializes the clock and the event list. The method <code>Sim.start</code> actually starts the simulation by advancing the clock to the time of the first event in the event list, removing this event from the list, and executing it. This is repeated until either <code>Sim.stop</code> is called or the event list becomes empty. <code>Sim.time</code> returns the current time on the simulation clock. Here, two events are scheduled before starting the simulation: the end of the simulation at time horizon, and the arrival of the first customer at a random time that has the exponential distribution with <em>rate</em> \(\lambda\) (i.e., <em>mean</em> \(1/\lambda\)), generated by <code>genArr</code> using inversion and its attached random stream. The method <code>genArr.nextDouble</code> returns this exponential random variate.</p>
<p>The method <code>actions</code> of the class <code>Arrival</code> describes what happens when an arrival occurs. Arrivals are scheduled by a domino effect: the first action of each arrival event schedules the next event in a random number of time units, generated from the exponential distribution with rate \(\lambda\). Then, the newly arrived customer is created, its arrival time is set to the current simulation time, and its service time is generated from the exponential distribution with mean \(1/\mu\), using the random variate generator <code>genServ</code>. If the server is busy, this customer is inserted at the end of the queue (the list <code>waitList</code>) and the statistical probe <code>totWait</code>, that keeps track of the size of the queue, is updated. Otherwise, the customer is inserted in the server’s list <code>servList</code>, its departure is scheduled to happen in a number of time units equal to its service time, and a new observation of 0.0 is given to the statistical probe <code>custWaits</code> that collects the waiting times.</p>
<p>When a <code>Departure</code> event occurs, the customer in service is removed from the list (and disappears). If the queue is not empty, the first customer is removed from the queue (<code>waitList</code>) and inserted in the server’s list, and its departure is scheduled. The waiting time of that customer (the current time minus its arrival time) is given as a new observation to the probe <code>custWaits</code>, and the probe <code>totWait</code> is also updated with the new (reduced) size of the queue.</p>
<p>The event <code>EndOfSim</code> stops the simulation. Then the <code>main</code> routine regains control and prints statistical reports for the two probes. The results are shown in Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_res_QueueEv">QueueEv</a>. When calling <code>report</code> on an <code>Accumulate</code> object, an implicit update is done using the current simulation time and the last value given to <code>update</code>. In this example, this ensures that the <code>totWait</code> accumulator will integrate the total wait until the time horizon, because the simulation clock is still at that time when the report is printed. Without such an automatic update, the accumulator would integrate only up to the last update time before the time horizon.</p>

Continuous simulation: A prey-predator system</h2>
<p>We consider a classical prey-predator system, where the preys are food for the predators (see, e.g., <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_sLAW00a">[111]</a>&thinsp;, page 87). Let \(x(t)\) and \(z(t)\) be the numbers of preys and predators at time \(t\), respectively. These numbers are integers, but as an approximation, we shall assume that they are real-valued variables evolving according to the differential equations </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} x’(t) &amp; = r x(t) - c x(t) z(t) \\ z’(t) &amp; = -s z(t) + d x(t) z(t) \end{align*}
</p>
<p> with initial values \(x(0)=x_0&gt;0\) et \(z(0)=z_0&gt;0\). This is a <em>Lotka-Volterra</em> system of differential equations, which has a known analytical solution. Here, in the program of Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_PreyPred">PreyPred</a>, we simply simulate its evolution, to illustrate the continuous simulation facilities of SSJ.</p>

<p>The program prints the triples \((t, x(t), z(t))\) at values of \(t\) that are multiples of <code>h</code>, one triple per line. This is done by an event of class <code>PrintPoint</code>, which is rescheduled at every <code>h</code> units of time.

The customers arrive randomly according to a Poisson process with piecewise constant rate \(\lambda(t)\), \(t\ge0\). The arrival rate \(\lambda(t)\) (see Fig.&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_fig_blambda">blambda</a> ) is 0.5 customer per minute from 9:45 until 11:00 and from 14:00 until 15:00, and one customer per minute from 11:00 until 14:00. The customers who arrive between 9:45 and 10:00 join a FIFO queue and wait for the bank to open. At 15:00, the door is closed, but all the customers already in will be served. Service starts at 10:00.</p>
<p>Customers form a FIFO queue for the tellers, with balking. An arriving customer will balk (walk out) with probability \(p_k\) if there are \(k\) customers ahead of him in the queue (not counting the people receiving service), where </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ p_k = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if $k\le5$;} \\ (n-5)/5 &amp; \text{if $5 &lt; k &lt; 10$;} \\ 1 &amp; \text{if $k\ge10$.} \end{cases} \]
</p>
<p> The customer service times are independent Erlang random variables: Each service time is the sum of two independent exponential random variables with mean one.</p>
<p>We want to estimate the expected number of customers served in a day, and the expected average wait for the customers served on a day.</p>
<p>Listing&#160; <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_BankEv">BankEv</a> gives and event-oriented simulation program for this bank model. There are events at the fixed times 9:45, 10:00, etc. At 9:45, the counters are initialized and the arrival process is started. The time until the first arrival, or the time between one arrival and the next one, is (tentatively) an exponential with a mean of 2 minutes. However, as soon as an arrival turns out to be past 11:00, its time must be readjusted to take into account the increase of the arrival rate at 11:00. The event 11:00 takes care of this readjustment, and the event at 14:00 makes a similar readjustment when the arrival rate decreases. We give the specific name <code>nextArriv</code> to the next planned arrival event in order to be able to reschedule that particular event to a different time. Note that a <em>single</em> arrival event is created at the beginning and this same event is scheduled over and over again. This can be done because there is never more than one arrival event in the event list. (We could have done that as well for the \(M/M/1\) queue in Listing <a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_QueueEv">QueueEv</a>.)</p>
<p>At the bank opening at 10:00, an event generates the number of tellers and starts the service for the corresponding customers. The event at 15:00 cancels the next arrival.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, a customer checks if a teller is free. If so, one teller becomes busy and the customer generates its service time and schedules his departure, otherwise the customer either balks or joins the queue. The balking decision is computed by the method <code>balk</code>, using the random number stream <code>streamBalk</code>. The arrival event also generates the next scheduled arrival. Upon departure, the customer frees the teller, and the first customer in the queue, if any, can start its service. The generator <code>genServ</code> is an <code>ErlangConvolutionGen</code> generator, so that the Erlang variates are generated by adding two exponentials instead of using inversion.</p>
<p>The method <code>simulateDays</code> simulates the bank for <code>numDays</code> days and prints a statistical report. If \(X_i\) is the number of customers served on day \(i\) and \(Q_i\) the total waiting time on day \(i\), the program estimates \(E[X_i]\) and \(E[Q_i]\) by their sample averages \(\bar{X}_n\) and \(\bar{Q}_n\) with \(n = \)<code>numDays</code>. For each simulation run (each day), <code>simulOneDay</code> initializes the clock, event list, and statistical probe for the waiting times, schedules the deterministic events, and runs the simulation. After 15:00, no more arrival occurs and the event list becomes empty when the last customer departs.

A call center</h2>
<p>We consider here a simplified model of a telephone contact center (or <em>call center</em>) where agents answer incoming calls. Each day, the center operates for \(m\) hours. The number of agents answering calls and the arrival rate of calls vary during the day; we shall assume that they are constant within each hour of operation but depend on the hour. Let \(n_j\) be the number of agents in the center during hour \(j\), for \(j=0,…,m-1\). For example, if the center operates from 8 am to 9 pm, then \(m=13\) and hour \(j\) starts at ( \(j+8\)) o’clock. All agents are assumed to be identical. When the number of occupied agents at the end of hour \(j\) is larger than \(n_{j+1}\), ongoing calls are all completed but new calls are answered only when there are less than \(n_{j+1}\) agents busy. After the center closes, ongoing calls are completed and calls already in the queue are answered, but no additional incoming call is taken.</p>
<p>The calls arrive according to a Poisson process with piecewise constant rate, equal to \(R_j = B \lambda_j\) during hour \(j\), where the \(\lambda_j\) are constants and \(B\) is a random variable having the gamma distribution with parameters \((\alpha_0,\alpha_0)\). Thus, \(B\) has mean 1 and variance \(1/\alpha_0\), and it represents the <em>busyness</em> of the day; it is more busy than usual when \(B &gt; 1\) and less busy when \(B &lt; 1\). The Poisson process assumption means that conditional on \(B\), the number of incoming calls during any subinterval \((t_1, t_2]\) of hour \(j\) is a Poisson random variable with mean \((t_2 - t_1) B \lambda_j\) and that the arrival counts in any disjoint time intervals are independent random variables. This arrival process model is motivated and studied in <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_ccWHI99c">[216]</a>&thinsp; and <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_ccAVR04a">[11]</a>&thinsp;.</p>
<p>Incoming calls form a FIFO queue for the agents. A call is <em>lost</em> (abandons the queue) when its waiting time exceed its <em>patience time</em>. The patience times of calls are assumed to be i.i.d. random variables with the following distribution: with probability \(p\) the patience time is 0 (so the person hangs up unless there is an agent available immediately), and with probability \(1-p\) it is exponential with mean \(1/\nu\). The service times are i.i.d. gamma random variables with parameters \((\alpha,\beta)\).</p>
<p>We want to estimate the following quantities <em>in the long run</em> (i.e., over an infinite number of days): (a) \(w\), the average waiting time per call, (b) \(g(s)\), the fraction of calls whose waiting time is less than \(s\) seconds for a given threshold \(s\), and (c) \(\ell\), the fraction of calls lost due to abandonment.</p>
<p>Suppose we simulate the model for \(n\) days. For each day \(i\), let \(A_i\) be the number of arrivals, \(W_i\) the total waiting time of all calls, \(G_i(s)\) the number of calls who waited less than \(s\) seconds, and \(L_i\) the number of abandonments. For this model, the expected number of incoming calls in a day is \(a = E[A_i] = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \lambda_j\). Then, \(W_i/a\), \(G_i(s)/a\), and \(L_i/a\), \(i=1,…,n\), are i.i.d. unbiased estimators of \(w\), \(g(s)\), and \(\ell\), respectively, and can be used to compute confidence intervals for these quantities in a standard way if \(n\) is large.</p>

<a class="el" href="examples.html#REF_examples_lst_CallCenter">CallCenter</a> gives an event-oriented simulation program for this call center model. When the <code>CallCenter</code> class is instantiated by the <code>main</code> method, the random streams, list, and statistical probes are created, and the model parameters are read from a file by the method <code>readData</code>. The line <code>Locale.setDefault(Locale.US)</code> is added because real numbers in the data file are read in the anglo-saxon form 8.3 instead of the form 8,3 used by most countries in the world. The <code>main</code> program then simulates \(n = 1000\) operating days and prints the value of \(a\), as well as 90% confidence intervals on \(a\), \(w\), \(g(s)\), and \(\ell\), based on their estimators \(\bar{A}_n\), \(\bar{W}_n/a\), \(\bar{G}_n(s)/a\), and \(\bar{L}_n/a\), assuming that these estimators have approximately the Student distribution. This is justified by the fact that \(W_i\), and \(G_i(s)\), and \(L_i\) are themselves “averages” over several observations, so we may expect their distribution to be not far from a normal.</p>
<p>To generate the service times, we use a gamma random variate generator called <code>genServ</code>, created in the constructor after the parameters \((\alpha,\beta)\) of the service time distribution have been read from the data file. For the other random variables in the model, we simply create random streams of i.i.d. uniforms (in the preamble) and apply inversion explicitly to generate the random variates. The latter approach is more convenient, e.g., for patience times because their distribution is not standard and for the inter-arrival times because their mean changes every period. For the gamma service time distribution, on the other hand, the parameters always remain the same and inversion is rather slow, so we decided to create a generator that uses a faster special method.</p>
<p>The method <code>simulateOneDay</code> simulates one day of operation. It initializes the simulation clock, event list, and counters, schedules the center’s opening and the first arrival, and starts the simulation. When the day is over, it updates the statistical collectors. Note that there are two versions of this method; one that generates the random variate \(B\) and the other that takes its value as an input parameter. This is convenient in case one wishes to simulate the center with a fixed value of \(B\).</p>
<p>An event <code>NextPeriod(j)</code> marks the beginning of each period \(j\). The first of these events (for \(j=0\)) is scheduled by <code>simulateOneDay</code>; then the following ones schedule each other successively, until the end of the day. This type of event updates the number of agents in the center and the arrival rate for the next period. If the number of agents has just increased and the queue is not empty, some calls in the queue can now be answered. The method <code>checkQueue</code> verifies this and starts service for the appropriate number of calls. The time until the next planned arrival is readjusted to take into account the change of arrival rate, as follows. The inter-arrival times are i.i.d. exponential with mean \(1/R_{j-1}\) when the arrival rate is fixed at \(R_{j-1}\). But when the arrival rate changes from \(R_{j-1}\) to \(R_j\), the residual time until the next arrival should be modified from an exponential with mean \(1/R_{j-1}\) (already generated) to an exponential with mean \(1/R_j\). Multiplying the residual time by \(\lambda_{j-1}/\lambda_j\) is an easy way to achieve this. We give the specific name <code>nextArrival</code> to the next arrival event in order to be able to reschedule it to a different time. Note that there is a <em>single</em> arrival event which is scheduled over and over again during the entire simulation. This is more efficient than creating a new arrival event for each call, and can be done here because there is never more than one arrival event at a time in the event list. At the end of the day, simply canceling the next arrival makes sure that no more calls will arrive.</p>
<p>Each arrival event first schedules the next one. Then it increments the arrivals counter and creates the new call that just arrived. The call’s constructor generates its service time and decides where the incoming call should go. If an agent is available, the call is answered immediately (its waiting time is zero), and an event is scheduled for the completion of the call. Otherwise, the call must join the queue; its patience time is generated by <code>generPatience</code> and memorized, together with its arrival time, for future reference.</p>
<p>Upon completion of a call, the number of busy agents is decremented and one must verify if a waiting call can now be answered. The method <code>checkQueue</code> verifies that and if the answer is yes, it removes the first call from the queue and activates its <code>endWait</code> method. This method first compares the call’s waiting time with its patience time, to see if this call is still waiting or has been lost (by abandonment). If the call was lost, we consider its waiting time as being equal to its patience time (i.e., the time that the caller has really waited), for the statistics. If the call is still there, the number of busy agents is incremented and an event is scheduled for the call completion.</p>

It can be embellished and made more realistic by considering different types of agents, different types of calls, agents taking breaks for lunch, coffee, or going to the restroom, agents making outbound calls to reach customers when the inbound traffic is low (e.g., for marketing purpose or for returning calls), and so on. One could also model the revenue generated by calls and the operating costs for running the center, and use the simulation model to compare alternative operating strategies in terms of the expected net revenue, for example. </p>
